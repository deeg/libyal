# Using macOS pkgbuild
pkgbuild can be used to create a macOS package.

The following instructions show how to build ${project_name}.pkg and ${project_name}.dmg from the command line.

First build ${project_name}:
```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local${macos_pkg_configure_options}
make
```

Next install the build files using DESTDIR
```
make install DESTDIR=$$PWD/tmp
```

This will make sure that library paths in the dylib file is set correctly for distribution.
This is not the case when you use:
```
./configure --prefix=$$PWD/tmp${macos_pkg_configure_options}
```

You can check the library paths in the dylib by running:
```
otool -LT tmp/usr/lib/${project_name}.1.dylib
```

After running "make install" the binaries are installed in:
```
$$PWD/tmp/
```

If you are planning to distribute ${project_name}.pkg make sure it contains a copy of LGPL license:
```
mkdir -p $$PWD/tmp/usr/share/doc/${project_name}
cp AUTHORS COPYING NEWS README $$PWD/tmp/usr/share/doc/${project_name}
```

To create the package (directory):
```
pkgbuild --root $$PWD/tmp --identifier com.github.libyal.${project_name} --version <version> --ownership recommended ../${project_name}-<version>.pkg
```

To create a distributable disk image:
```
hdiutil create ../${project_name}-<version>.dmg -srcfolder ../${project_name}-<version>.pkg -fs HFS+
```
